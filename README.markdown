Realtime Thread Safety Watchdog
===============================

This library for iOS acts as a watchdog for activities on the Core Audio thread that are considered unsafe:

1. Taking locks
2. Allocating memory
3. Using Objective-C
4. File or network IO

It works by overriding a number of system functions, including `malloc`, `free`, `objc_storeStrong`, `objc_msgSend` (for 64-bit devices and the 64-bit simulator only, for now), `pthread_mutex_lock` and `objc_sync_enter`, `read`, `write`, etc. When a call is intercepted, a warning is printed to the console. You can also put a breakpoint on `AERealtimeWatchdogUnsafeActivityWarning`.

It won’t catch everything, and it won’t catch anything in Apple’s own system code, but it’ll catch some locks, some memory allocation, all Objective-C use (but not Swift), all object retains, and some common IO tasks, in your code and that of any static libraries you’re using.

This library is also built into [The Amazing Audio Engine 2](http://github.com/TheAmazingAudioEngine/TheAmazingAudioEngine2).

Usage
-----

With Cocoapods: add the "`RealtimeWatchdog`" pod to your Podfile, and call `pod install`. Done!

Without Cocoapods:

1. Drag *RealtimeWatchdog.xcodeproj* into your project. 
2. Select your app target's Build Settings, open the "Link Binary With Libraries" item, click the "+" button and select *libRealtimeWatchdog.a*. Done.

If you get any errors about implicit dependencies, you may also need to open the "Target Dependencies" item, and add *RealtimeWatchdog* there.

You can easily disable the monitor by commenting out the `#define REALTIME_WATCHDOG_ENABLED 1` line in `AERealtimeWatchdog.h`.

It will only be active for debug builds, so you can leave it on safely.

Note that for 64-bit devices and the 64-bit simulator, this library provides its own wrapper implementation of `objc_msgSend`, which means Objective-C method calls will be marginally slower.
